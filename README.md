# Product search

Your task is to implement a product listing feature. The products are available from the [products.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/servicepos/projectsearch/0f840c4a3793eca4f0c22141238f02373bbe49ea/products.json) file included in this repository. Your solution should make it possible for users to browse and search the products.

### Getting started
1. Choose your framework
2. Create a new git repository and commit your solution to this repository.
3. Implement your solution to match the requirements below.
4. When you are done, please send us a link to your repository. (You could use GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket or similar to host your repository)

We look forward to seeing your solution.

## Functional requirements:
1. Your solution must include a list of products.
   1. The products should be fetched from the products.json file (Hint: if you use Angular you should use the HttpClient to fetch the products.json file. https://angular.io/guide/http-request-data-from-server)
   2. The list should be paginated (Hint: slice)
2. The list of products should be searchable (Hint: https://www.learnrxjs.io/learn-rxjs/recipes/type-ahead)
   1. The search results should be updated while typing in the search input. The search should debounced to prevent unnecessary fetches of the products.json file. When implemented correctly, the search should only fetch the products.json file once, when the user has stopped typing for a short period of time. Test your app functions correctly by simulating a slow connection in Dev Tools -> Network -> Fast 3G. Any pending search must be cancelled if a new search is triggered. This mean only once search can be fetching at any time.
   2. The search should be implemented in a fulltext manner, so that searching for "Power SRAM" will find the product "SRAM Power Pack PG-1050‚Äù.

## Technical requirements:

1. Your solution should be implemented using a modern framework like Angular, React, Vue.js or similar.
2. Demonstrate that you understand relevant technologies in your chosen framework
   1. Separation of components, services etc.
3. Show you know how to handle callbacks or asynchronous code using: Observables, Promises, Signals or similar.
4. Use GIT as your version control

## Optional requirements:

If you find the task too easy, or want further challenges, you can consider the following list of ideas to extend your solution.

1. Detailed product view
   1. When selecting a product in the list a detail/edit view should be shown.
   2. If your chosen framework supports routing, you could add support for linking directly to a selected product.
2. Update products
   1. Add an edit form to allow users to update products.
   2. If you want, you could store the products fetched from the json file in a local cache (variable in TS, in your service, indexedDB or similar), and then write your updated products to this store.
3. Authentication
   1. Add a login page to your project. Making sure that only authenticated users are allowed to browse the products.
   2. Optionally add support for authorization, so that only certain users have access to all features of your project. For instance you could limit access to the searching feature, details view, edit view or similar.
4. Your own ideas are welcome too! If you can think of a cool technology or feature, you would like to create, we encourage you to do so.
